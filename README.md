# NFT App

Dummy NFT App made with React Native for learning. Notable features are design and UI only. Oh.. you can filter the available NFTs usingn the Search Bar. I will add some other features soon.

You can view the app with Expo. I have also made a landing page for this app. You can access it [Landing Page](https://broad-cake-5668.on.fleek.co/)

The `main` branch is having the code for the React Native App while the `frontend` branch is having the code for the landing page of the App.

### Technologies used:

- React
